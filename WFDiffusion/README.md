The algorithms are coded in Ox

Please, download Ox Console (including OxEdit) from the link https://www.doornik.com/download.html.

There is a main file which is the one to be run and contains all the required specifications to be set.

The data set used in the paper is saved under the file X.mat.
The first row of the file contains its number of rows and columns (Ox format).


To generate a data set, run the file "data.ox"

To run the MCMC algorithm, run the file "mcmc.ox"
